Project Description
Companies often require miscellaneous “low-skill” tasks, for which they hire third party agencies. For companies >500 employees, an entire team within the organization is dedicated to seeking out, negotiating and hiring low-skilled labor.

Low-skilled workers usually do not have control over their schedules, and tend to stick with the same employer despite any shortcomings of the working conditions.
